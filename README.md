# Use Discrete Event Simulation to estimate the Port Network Traffic Capacity

## A study for the expansion in TECON Salvador quay infrastructure

A Discrete Event Simulation (DES) its a system simulation that only changes with a event request. There are many examples for this kind of system, such as bank queue, cars incoming in a gas station and, in this case, the traffic of ships in the Port of Salvador. In this job, the objective is measure the performance of quay infrastructure of Container Terminals of Salvador (TECON Salvador) and estimate the Port Network Traffic Capacity (PNTC), that means, the outflow of ships results the minimum cost of Terminal operation.

The performance of a quay is measure by diferent indicators, the most important is the occupation (share of time that quay is occupied), the waiting time (time that fundeation of ships, waiting to operation). For the estimate the PNTC, is utilized the Macr√≥pico Fundamental Diagram. For more informations, see: Olba et. all (2015).

The simulation script was writed in: Simulation.ipynb, an extension for Jupyter Lab.

For the simulation, its utilized Simpy, a process-based discrete-event simulation framework based on standard Python. Read more: https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

All this report was writing in Portuguese. (Sorry :/). I hope that the code was useful for you guys!

This job was used as a requirement to my graduation as a civil engeneer in the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC). Any questions, please write to me. My linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/leonardo-ramos-a31a73a7/

Thats the beauty on Linkedin, heuheuehhu
